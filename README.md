# Calculator App
This is a calculator app built using React.js and TypeScript (using no other third-party libraries). 

This calculator performs several basic functionalities:
* addition
* subtraction
* multiplication
* division
* exponentiation
* modulo
* radical
*  Other misc, functionalities include displaying a history feature.

The app can be found here: https://650e3e80fb627700088e0624--sparkly-selkie-487e61.netlify.app/

## Project Instructions
1. Simply open your IDE and in the terminal and run:
```npm start```

## Development Overview

The development for this app is structured into several components:
* Objective

  
* Planning
  
* Design
  
* Functionalities
  
* Error Handling
  
* Miscellaneous (Modularization)
  
* Testing
Testing involves many different test cases. This involves testing each unique case, such as if a user enters operations in multiple successions, or if expressions are calculated through different arithmetic operations in a row.

Testing involves debugging using Chrome DevTools to monitor the output displayed using the console.log(). This is used to observe the activity through key presses or clicks. Status checks are spread out throughout the code in order for the user or developer to observe the event when an action is triggered.

Another debugging method used is observing React's runtime error. As I am more familiar with JavaScript than TypeScript, this is particularly useful in observing the different issues that occur with pieces of code. This is also used to monitor mistakes with code syntax, variables, types, and etc.


### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed! The easiest way to deploy will likely either be to use [Github Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages), but you can use any hosting option. To learn more about deployment, see the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).
